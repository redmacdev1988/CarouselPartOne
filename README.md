# React Carousel

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is the skeleton of creating a carousel using:

- Typescript
- React
- Sass
## Data Structure

- We implement an array in OOP and FP fashion in order to hold image urls. (src/Circularlist)

## Rendering

- We then use in React framework to do the rendering. 
- We simulate fetching of the images with setTimeout and returning an array of valid urls in function getImageUrls.
- We have a Gallery component that does render (re-rendering) if the user sorts or re-fetches data.

### `npm run start`
